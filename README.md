This is where I keep my Kubernetes cluster state. [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/)
and [Helm-operator](https://docs.fluxcd.io/projects/helm-operator/) do the heavy
lifting. I hide my secrets from you using [sealed
secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets).

I have licensed my cluster state GPL 3.0.
